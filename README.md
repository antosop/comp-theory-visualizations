# comp-theory-visualizations
Project to practice rich front end development while implementing basic lessons learned from computational theory.

## Get Started
* run <code>npm install</code> to install project dependencies listed in package.json
* run <code>node server.js</code> will start the server which will be hosted on port 3000
  * webpack will continue to update any asset changes you make so you don't have to restart the server.
  * the main entry point for the project is main.js if you add modules (webpack) you will need to "require" them in the main.js entry point.
